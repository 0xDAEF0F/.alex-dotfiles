# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  - trigger: ":exa"
    replace: "- use exa mcp server for web search and github search"

  - trigger: ":context7"
    replace: "- use context7 mcp server to search for the library/tool documentation"

  - trigger: ":rust-docs"
    replace: "- use rust-docs mcp server to search for the library/tool documentation (check if its embedded, if not, embed it first and then you can check its status and query for semantic search)"

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
