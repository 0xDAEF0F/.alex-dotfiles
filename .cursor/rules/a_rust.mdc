- use `anyhow` for error handling
- prefer to use `tokio` over the std libraries blocking primitives
- use `log` for logging (except for tests)
- if you see a `#![allow(unused)]` do not remove it.
- if you are going to add dependencies, do so by doing: `cargo add <name-of-dep>` instead of editing `Cargo.toml` directly.
- never use `cargo doc` to view documentation. use the mcp tools, instead
- opt for `anyhow::bail!("<msg>")` instead of `Err(anyhow::anyhow!("<msg>"))` (they are semantically equivalent)
- before finalizing your request â€”  always make sure that the project compiles and there are no linting errors
