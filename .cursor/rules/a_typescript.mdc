# TS/JS Ecosystem

- Make sure to check `package.json` and lockfiles to know what package manager to use.
- Be cautious of whether you are in a monorepo or not.
- All functions and variables must be explicitly typed. i.e., args, return types (unless they are too complex)
- Don't use type assertion `as <type>` in typescript unless it is absolutely necessary.
- Don't use arrow functions unless they can be quickly inlined and within another function.
- Tests must end with `.test.ts` and they must be located next to the file that implements the function that will be tested.
