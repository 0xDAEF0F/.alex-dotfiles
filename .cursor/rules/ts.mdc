# User Preferences
- All functions must be explicitly typed: return types and arguments
- All variables must be explicitly typed even if the types can be inferred, unless the types are too complex.

# Runtime
- Always check for the `package-json` file to retrieve context about the project.
- Bun is our runtime environment so please use all operations with Bun:
    - Add packages: `bun add [package]`
    - Removing packages: `bun remove [package]`
    - Running test files: `bun test [path-to-file]`
    - Running scripts: `bun run [path-to-file]`
