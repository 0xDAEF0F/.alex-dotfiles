# User Preferences

- All functions and variables must be explicitly typed. i.e., args, return types (unless too complex)
- Don't use type assertion `as <type>` in typescript unless it is absolutely necessary. Opt for `let var: <Type> = <value>`
- Don't use arrow functions unless they can be quickly inlined and part of another function
- Tests must end with `.test.ts` and they must be located next to the file that implements the function 
  that will be tested. 
- If you are in the root of a bun workspace. You can run scripts from a `package.json` under that root directory like: `bun run --cwd <dir> <script-name>`
- Functions in a file should be ordered from highest to lowest importance
- In Bun, the entrypoint file must not be wrapped in `main` function.

# Runtime

- Always check for the `package-json` file to retrieve context about the project.
- Bun is our runtime environment so please use all operations with Bun:
    - `bun add [package]`
    - `bun remove [package]`
    - `bun test [path-to-file]`
    - `bun run [path-to-file]`
