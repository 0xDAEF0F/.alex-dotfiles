# Rules

- Use shadcn components as your default component library, if you need something more customized
  just do it from scratch with tailwindcss
- When styling a library component, use their default classes for that component, if not possible, use tailwindcss
- Make sure to use "lucide react" as the default icon library
- Use server components over client components (unless reactivity is necessary)
- As a rule of thumb, fetch data within server components and pass the data as props to the client component that needs it (not set in stone)
- React components' arguments should be named `props` and it's corresponding type: `type Props = {}`; must be located directly above the component
- React components should not be exported as default
- We should preferably use Next.js `Image` component instead of `img`
