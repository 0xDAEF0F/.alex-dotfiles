# Git commit policy - Conventional Commits v1.0.0

- For commit requests, be brief and focus on intent; avoid repeating the obvious
- Commit messages must 1-3 sentences (depending on the amount of changes)

Format every **commit title** as:

<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>

* **type** — one of  
  `feat fix docs style refactor perf test build ci chore revert`
* **scope** — optional noun in parentheses, e.g. `(parser)`
* **!** — optional flag for a breaking change, placed just before the colon
* **description** — short, imperative mood, lower-case first letter, no trailing period, ≤ 50 characters

## Examples

feat(lang): add Polish language support
fix(api)!: return 400 on invalid token
docs: update README installation section
chore(deps): bump tokio to 1.38.0
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident

**Reject any commit that does not follow these rules.**
