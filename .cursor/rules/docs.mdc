# Docs Rules

•	Library documentation is stored in the `lib-docs/` directory at the repo root.
•	Each file contains the full, recursively copied documentation for a single library.
•	A Table of Contents at the top lists all included files; use it to grep efficiently instead of scanning the whole file.
•	Sections are delimited with `// ~~ File: <file>` and `// ~~ End of File: <file>` markers.
