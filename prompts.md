# AI Prompts

Overall prompting format:

1. Goal - Overall task (what, not how)
2. Response format - List, pros/cons, diff, etc.
3. Warnings - Common pitfalls you might encounter with the problem.
4. Context - All the relevant context for the problem.

## In-depth research (interview style)

```markdown
I want to create a strong prompt for an AI to go off and do
research for me on: [topic].

Below are some constraints of what im interested in, but i'm
not sure what else to include.

Can you ask me a series of questions one at a time, each answer
will inform your next question, then at the end craft a detailed
prompt with plenty of context, so that the AI can do a longer form
research report for me on [topic].

Context: [insert context here]
